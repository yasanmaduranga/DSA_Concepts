What is a Stack?

A stack is a linear data structure that allows operations to be performed at one end, called the top. The two primary operations are:

Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
Pop: Removes and returns the top element from the stack.

Stacks are widely used in various applications, such as function call management, undo mechanisms, and parsing expressions.

Operations Performed on a Stack
Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
Pop: Removes and returns the top element from the stack.
Peek (or Top): Returns the top element without removing it.
isEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty.
Size: Returns the number of elements in the stack.
